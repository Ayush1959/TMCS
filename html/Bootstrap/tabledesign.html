            <div style="text-align:justify;">Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a subsumption of multiple taxes such as
                Excise
                duty, Sales tax, Service tax, state-level value added tax, etc. In brief, GST is a consolidated tax
                formed
                upon merging state and central taxes. This ensures the whole country to have one uniform tax rate. Any
                organization with annual sales more than Rs. 20 Lakhs is required to register as a normal taxable
                person
                and that is termed GST registration in India. Even if the annual sales of your organization is less
                than 20
                lakhs, we recommend you to get a new GST registration to avail the below mentioned benefits:

                <ul style="font-size: 15px;">
                    <li>To be able to sell out of the state</li>
                    <li>To avail tax refunds on purchases</li>
                </ul>
